## 🎨 About the Image Errors:

The errors you see like:
```
via.placeholder.com/100?text=Medicine:1 Failed to load resource
```

**This is COMPLETELY NORMAL!** Here's why:

1. **What they are:**
   - Placeholder image URLs
   - Used when no real image is uploaded
   - Show "Medicine" text as placeholder

2. **Why they fail:**
   - DNS resolution issues
   - Network restrictions
   - Firewall blocking
   - **Not a bug in your code!**

3. **Does it affect functionality?**
   - **NO!** Everything still works
   - Products display fine
   - Cart works
   - Checkout works
   - Orders work

4. **How to fix (optional):**
   - Use local placeholder images
   - Upload real medicine images
   - Or just ignore - it's cosmetic only
